# PlaylistManager
This project was our final project in my DataStructures course for undergrad. We used C++ as the language and Visual Studios as our development IDE. 
This program utilized basic C++ practices such as classes, structs, constructors, get, set, multi-file directory, switch statements, input statements.
It shows the user a menu with numbered options to choose from, then instructs the user to choose which number corresponds with their action. The user may then input a number 1-10 to commit actions such as adding a song to the end of the playlist, to inserting a song before another, removing any song of their choice (by title) and archiving it, displaying songs in the playlist, requesting a song to be played (add to a queue), simulate play requested songs, simulate playing a selected song, searching for a specific song (by title), and moving through the playlist to previous and next songs based on which song has been selected. Finally, when the user wants to be done, they may enter 0 to exit the program.
